<p>
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu">Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.
Previously, I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from the <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at Stanford University, advised by Professor <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/">Andrea Montanari</a>. Prior to Stanford, I received my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>.

My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, sampling, and deep learning theory. 
In particular, I am currently very interested in establishing theoretical underpinnings of diffusion models. Here is my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAAj2XoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar</a> page and <a href="pdf/CV_Yuchen_Wu.pdf">CV</a></p>.
