I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, advised by Professors <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/">Andrea Montanari</a>. Prior to Stanford, I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>.

My research interests include high dimensional statistics, theory of deep learning, MCMC in high dimensions, and transfer learning. Here is my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAAj2XoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar</a> page.
